Unity: Detect Character Controller Problems And Fix

This is meant as example code, because you will not have all the structure required to support this example matching my game.  Every game is too different to make something that works unverisally, and it would be too hard to understand with all the scaffolding needed to make it that pluggable.

Instead, this is meant to be copy-pasted, and then change the bits you need to match your game, or just read to understand the structure of how I'm trying to solve the problem.

The code does work from my initial testing, but is not being supplied as production quality code, just an easy to understand example.  It's purpose was clarity, since detecting and fixing problems involves understanding what's happening and not being confused about the logic of what is getting decided, or the process of testing making that harder to understand.

I have a blog post about this with video examples here: https://allhailtemos.com/blog/detecting-and-fixing-problems-unity-c-code-1

YouTube video of the falling-forever-on-the-ground problem is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1UYwLM8G2E
